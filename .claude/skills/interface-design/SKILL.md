# Interface Design (PyQt6)

Build desktop interface design with craft and consistency.

## Scope

**Use for:** Desktop apps, dashboards, admin panels, tools, settings dialogs — built with PyQt6.

**Not for:** Web pages, landing pages, marketing sites.

**Tech stack:** PyQt6, QSS (Qt Style Sheets), QWidget, QLayout.

# The Problem

You will generate generic output. Your training has seen thousands of dashboards. The patterns are strong.

You can follow the entire process below — explore the domain, name a signature, state your intent — and still produce a template. Warm colors on cold structures. Friendly fonts on generic layouts. "Kitchen feel" that looks like every other app.

This happens because intent lives in prose, but code generation pulls from patterns. The gap between them is where defaults win.

The process below helps. But process alone doesn't guarantee craft. You have to catch yourself.

---

# Where Defaults Hide

Defaults don't announce themselves. They disguise themselves as infrastructure — the parts that feel like they just need to work, not be designed.

**Typography feels like a container.** Pick something readable, move on. But typography isn't holding your design — it IS your design. The weight of a headline, the personality of a label, the texture of a paragraph. These shape how the product feels before anyone reads a word. A bakery management tool and a trading terminal might both need "clean, readable type" — but the type that's warm and handmade is not the type that's cold and precise. If you're reaching for the system default font, you're not designing.

**Navigation feels like scaffolding.** Build the QTreeWidget/QListWidget sidebar, add the items, get to the real work. But navigation isn't around your product — it IS your product. Where you are, where you can go, what matters most. A window floating in space is a widget demo, not software. The navigation teaches people how to think about the space they're in.

**Data feels like presentation.** You have numbers, show numbers. But a number on screen is not design. The question is: what does this number mean to the person looking at it? What will they do with it? A QProgressBar and a QLabel both show "3 of 10" — one tells a story, one fills space. If you're reaching for number-on-label, you're not designing.

**Style names feel like implementation detail.** But your QSS properties are design decisions. Named colors like `--ink` and `--parchment` evoke a world. `gray700` and `surface2` evoke a template. Someone reading only your style constants should be able to guess what product this is.

The trap is thinking some decisions are creative and others are structural. There are no structural decisions. Everything is design. The moment you stop asking "why this?" is the moment defaults take over.

# Intent First

Before touching code, answer these. Not in your head — out loud, to yourself or the user.

**Who is this human?**
Not "users." The actual person. Where are they when they open this? What's on their mind? What did they do 5 minutes ago, what will they do 5 minutes after? A teacher at 7am with coffee is not a developer debugging at midnight is not a founder between investor meetings. Their world shapes the interface.

**What must they accomplish?**
Not "use the app." The verb. Queue this article for reading. Find the broken word mapping. Adjust the playback speed. The answer determines what leads, what follows, what hides.

**What should this feel like?**
Say it in words that mean something. "Clean and modern" means nothing — every AI says that. Warm like a notebook? Cold like a terminal? Dense like a trading floor? Calm like a reading app? The answer shapes color, type, spacing, density — everything.

If you cannot answer these with specifics, stop. Ask the user. Do not guess. Do not default.

## Every Choice Must Be A Choice

For every decision, you must be able to explain WHY.

- Why this layout and not another?
- Why this color temperature?
- Why this typeface?
- Why this spacing scale?
- Why this information hierarchy?

If your answer is "it's common" or "it's clean" or "it works" — you haven't chosen. You've defaulted. Defaults are invisible. Invisible choices compound into generic output.

**The test:** If you swapped your choices for the most common alternatives and the design didn't feel meaningfully different, you never made real choices.

## Sameness Is Failure

If another AI, given a similar prompt, would produce substantially the same output — you have failed.

This is not about being different for its own sake. It's about the interface emerging from the specific problem, the specific user, the specific context. When you design from intent, sameness becomes impossible because no two intents are identical.

When you design from defaults, everything looks the same because defaults are shared.

## Intent Must Be Systemic

Saying "warm" and using cold colors is not following through. Intent is not a label — it's a constraint that shapes every decision.

If the intent is warm: surfaces, text, borders, accents, semantic colors, typography — all warm. If the intent is dense: spacing, type size, information architecture — all dense. If the intent is calm: motion, contrast, color saturation — all calm.

Check your output against your stated intent. Does every token reinforce it? Or did you state an intent and then default anyway?

# Product Domain Exploration

This is where defaults get caught — or don't.

Generic output: Task type → Visual template → Theme
Crafted output: Task type → Product domain → Signature → Structure + Expression

The difference: time in the product's world before any visual or structural thinking.

## Required Outputs

**Do not propose any direction until you produce all four:**

**Domain:** Concepts, metaphors, vocabulary from this product's world. Not features — territory. Minimum 5.

**Color world:** What colors exist naturally in this product's domain? Not "warm" or "cool" — go to the actual world. If this product were a physical space, what would you see? What colors belong there that don't belong elsewhere? List 5+.

**Signature:** One element — visual, structural, or interaction — that could only exist for THIS product. If you can't name one, keep exploring.

**Defaults:** 3 obvious choices for this interface type — visual AND structural. You can't avoid patterns you haven't named.

## Proposal Requirements

Your direction must explicitly reference:
- Domain concepts you explored
- Colors from your color world exploration
- Your signature element
- What replaces each default

**The test:** Read your proposal. Remove the product name. Could someone identify what this is for? If not, it's generic. Explore deeper.

# The Mandate

**Before showing the user, look at what you made.**

Ask yourself: "If they said this lacks craft, what would they mean?"

That thing you just thought of — fix it first.

Your first output is probably generic. That's normal. The work is catching it before the user has to.

## The Checks

Run these against your output before presenting:

- **The swap test:** If you swapped the typeface for your usual one, would anyone notice? If you swapped the layout for a standard Qt form, would it feel different? The places where swapping wouldn't matter are the places you defaulted.

- **The squint test:** Blur your eyes. Can you still perceive hierarchy? Is anything jumping out harshly? Craft whispers.

- **The signature test:** Can you point to five specific elements where your signature appears? Not "the overall feel" — actual widgets. A signature you can't locate doesn't exist.

- **The style test:** Read your QSS constants out loud. Do they sound like they belong to this product's world, or could they belong to any project?

If any check fails, iterate before showing.

# Craft Foundations

## Subtle Layering

This is the backbone of craft. Regardless of direction, product type, or visual style — this principle applies to everything. You should barely notice the system working. The craft is invisible — that's how you know it's working.

### Surface Elevation

Surfaces stack. A QMenu sits above a QGroupBox which sits above the QMainWindow. Build a numbered system — base, then increasing elevation levels. Higher elevation = slightly lighter background (dark theme) or subtle shadow (light theme).

Each jump should be only a few percentage points of lightness. You can barely see the difference in isolation. But when surfaces stack, the hierarchy emerges. Whisper-quiet shifts that you feel rather than see.

**Key decisions:**
- **Sidebars (QDockWidget/QFrame):** Same background as central widget, not different. Different colors fragment the visual space. A subtle border is enough separation.
- **Popups (QMenu, QComboBox dropdown):** One level above their parent surface. If both share the same level, the popup blends into the widget and layering is lost.
- **Inputs (QLineEdit, QTextEdit):** Slightly darker than their surroundings, not lighter. Inputs are "inset" — they receive content. A darker background signals "type here" without heavy borders.

### Borders

Borders should disappear when you're not looking for them, but be findable when you need structure. In QSS, use `border: 1px solid rgba(...)` with low alpha — it defines edges without demanding attention. Solid opaque borders look harsh in comparison.

Build a progression — not all borders are equal. Standard borders, softer separation, emphasis borders, maximum emphasis for focus indicators.

**The squint test:** Blur your eyes at the interface. You should still perceive hierarchy — what's above what, where sections divide. But nothing should jump out. No harsh lines. No jarring color shifts. Just quiet structure.

This separates professional interfaces from amateur ones. Get this wrong and nothing else matters.

## Infinite Expression

Every pattern has infinite expressions. **No interface should look the same.**

A metric display could be a hero number, inline stat, QProgressBar, gauge widget, comparison delta, or something new. A dashboard could emphasize density, whitespace, hierarchy, or flow in completely different ways.

**Before building, ask:**
- What's the ONE thing users do most here?
- What desktop products solve similar problems brilliantly? Study them.
- Why would this interface feel designed for its purpose, not templated?

**NEVER produce identical output.** Same sidebar width, same grid of QGroupBoxes, same metrics everywhere — this signals AI-generated immediately.

## Color Lives Somewhere

Every product exists in a world. That world has colors.

Before you reach for a palette, spend time in the product's world. What would you see if you walked into the physical version of this space?

Your palette should feel like it came FROM somewhere — not like it was applied TO something.

**Color Carries Meaning:** Gray builds structure. Color communicates — status, action, emphasis, identity. Unmotivated color is noise. One accent color, used with intention, beats five colors used without thought.

---

# Before Writing Each Component

**Every time** you write UI code — even small additions — state:

```
Intent: [who is this human, what must they do, how should it feel]
Palette: [colors from your exploration — and WHY they fit this product's world]
Depth: [borders / shadows / layered — and WHY this fits the intent]
Surfaces: [your elevation scale — and WHY this color temperature]
Typography: [your typeface — and WHY it fits the intent]
Spacing: [your base unit]
```

This checkpoint is mandatory. It forces you to connect every technical choice back to intent.

If you can't explain WHY for each choice, you're defaulting. Stop and think.

# Design Principles

## Token Architecture

Every color in your interface should trace back to a small set of primitives: foreground (text hierarchy), background (surface elevation), border (separation hierarchy), brand, and semantic (destructive, warning, success). No random hex values — everything maps to primitives. In PyQt6, define these as constants or in a central QSS file.

### Text Hierarchy

Build four levels — primary, secondary, tertiary, muted. Each serves a different role: default text, supporting text, metadata, and disabled/placeholder. Use all four consistently via `color:` in QSS.

### Border Progression

Build a scale that matches intensity to importance — standard separation, softer separation, emphasis, maximum emphasis. Use `border:` with varying `rgba()` alpha values.

### Control Tokens

Form controls (QLineEdit, QComboBox, QSpinBox) have specific needs. Don't reuse surface styles — create dedicated ones for control backgrounds, control borders, and focus states.

## Spacing

Pick a base unit and stick to multiples. Use `setContentsMargins()` and layout `setSpacing()` with consistent values. Build a scale for different contexts — micro spacing for icon gaps, component spacing within widgets, section spacing between groups.

## Padding

Keep it symmetrical. `setContentsMargins(16, 16, 16, 16)` — if one side has a value, others should match unless content naturally requires asymmetry.

## Depth

Choose ONE approach and commit:
- **Borders-only** — Clean, technical. For dense tools. Use `border:` in QSS.
- **Subtle shadows** — Use `QGraphicsDropShadowEffect` sparingly.
- **Surface color shifts** — Background tints establish hierarchy without shadows.

Don't mix approaches.

## Border Radius

Sharper feels technical. Rounder feels friendly. Use `border-radius:` in QSS. Build a scale — small for inputs and buttons, medium for group boxes, large for dialogs.

## Typography

Build distinct levels distinguishable at a glance. In PyQt6, use `QFont` with varying size, weight, and letter-spacing. Headlines need bold weight for presence. Body needs comfortable weight for readability. Labels need medium weight that works at smaller sizes. Data needs monospace for alignment.

## Iconography

Icons clarify, not decorate — if removing an icon loses no meaning, remove it. Choose one icon set and stick with it. In PyQt6, use `QIcon` consistently.

## Animation

In PyQt6, use `QPropertyAnimation` for transitions. Keep durations short (150-250ms) with `QEasingCurve.OutCubic`. Avoid bouncy effects in professional interfaces.

## States

Every interactive widget needs visual states: default, hover, pressed, focus, disabled. In QSS, use pseudo-states: `:hover`, `:pressed`, `:focus`, `:disabled`. Missing states feel broken.

## Navigation Context

Windows need grounding. A QTableWidget floating in space feels like a widget demo, not a product. Include navigation showing where you are in the app. In PyQt6, use QStatusBar, QToolBar, or sidebar QListWidget for context.

## Dark Mode

Dark interfaces have different needs. Borders become more important than shadows. Semantic colors (success, warning, error) often need slight desaturation. The hierarchy system still applies, just with inverted values. In PyQt6, implement via `QPalette` or QSS theme switching.

# Avoid

- **Harsh borders** — if borders are the first thing you see, they're too strong
- **Dramatic surface jumps** — elevation changes should be whisper-quiet
- **Inconsistent spacing** — the clearest sign of no system
- **Mixed depth strategies** — pick one approach and commit
- **Missing interaction states** — hover, focus, disabled
- **Default Qt styling** — the gray system look signals "no one designed this"
- **Large radius on small elements**
- **Thick decorative borders**
- **Multiple accent colors** — dilutes focus
- **Different hues for different surfaces** — keep the same hue, shift only lightness

# Workflow

## Communication
Be invisible. Don't announce modes or narrate process.

**Never say:** "I'm in ESTABLISH MODE", "Let me check system.md..."

**Instead:** Jump into work. State suggestions with reasoning.

## Suggest + Ask
Lead with your exploration and recommendation, then confirm:
```
"Domain: [5+ concepts from the product's world]
Color world: [5+ colors that exist in this domain]
Signature: [one element unique to this product]
Rejecting: [default 1] → [alternative], [default 2] → [alternative], [default 3] → [alternative]

Direction: [approach that connects to the above]"

[Ask: "Does that direction feel right?"]
```

## If Project Has system.md
Read `.interface-design/system.md` and apply. Decisions are made.

## If No system.md
1. Explore domain — Produce all four required outputs
2. Propose — Direction must reference all four
3. Confirm — Get user buy-in
4. Build — Apply principles
5. **Evaluate** — Run the mandate checks before showing
6. Offer to save

---

# After Completing a Task

When you finish building something, **always offer to save**:

```
"Want me to save these patterns for future sessions?"
```

If yes, write to `.interface-design/system.md`:
- Direction and feel
- Depth strategy (borders/shadows/layered)
- Spacing base unit
- QSS color constants
- Key widget patterns (with QSS snippets)

### What to Save

Add patterns when a widget is used 2+ times, is reusable across the project, or has specific measurements worth remembering. Don't save one-off widgets, temporary experiments, or variations better handled with parameters.

### Consistency Checks

If system.md defines values, check against them: spacing on the defined grid, depth using the declared strategy throughout, colors from the defined palette, documented patterns reused instead of reinvented.

This compounds — each save makes future work faster and more consistent.
